This article is trying to fulfill two different goals: firstly giving
an overview to \linux end-users how software is managed on their
computer and secondly explaining how to install or remove software
properly. If one force of \linux is its modularity and the huge amount
of alternatives to replace any system's subsystem, it is also very
difficult for newcomers to get a ``big picture'' of their system.

The following points will be discussed in this document:
\begin{itemize}
\item An overview of how \linux packaging is done
\item How to install or remove software using a tarball or a package,
\end{itemize}
